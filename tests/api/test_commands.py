# WARNING: tests requiring db access should use the function decorator:
# @pytest.mark.django_db
# which we overwrite to auto populate the db (see django_db_setup in conftest.py).
# This however pre-execute the same custom commands that we want to test here,
# causing problems in e.g. capturing the stdout. Looking at the code, to grant access
# to the empty db in the default Django mode, we just need the django_db_blocker fixture:

    managed by egsim

    NOTE: these are just shallow tests to check no error is raised. Deeper tests cannot
        be easily performed. An alternative is to issue bookmarks in the editor
        (e.g. PyCharm) and inspect the printout
