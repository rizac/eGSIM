<p><b>Endpoint: <code>{{ baseurl }}/{{ test }}</code></b></p>

<p>
eGSIM, through the GMPE-SMTK library, offers the ability to test observed ground motions with
the GMPE model predictions using the GMPE implementations found inside OpenQuake and
one or more measures of fit.
The request for such a service is outlined below. Note that the selection
expression has been described in <a href="#">the residuals section above</a>
</p>
 
<h3 id="{{ test }}_request">Request</h3>
<p>
A request to the Residuals plot service requires a list of GMPEs and IMTs, a Ground Motion
database (GMDB) and the the desired plot type. As discussed, parameters can be given in the endpoint
URL (GET method) or as separate text data in JSON or YAML format (POST method) and are:
</p>

<table class='request'>
	{% include "apidoc/request_template.html" with form=form.testing %}
	<tfoot>
	<tr><td colspan='2'>Notes:</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan='2'>"SA" in {{ form.trellis.imt.name }} must be provided
		with the given period in parentheses, e.g. "SA(0.2)".
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan='2'> {{ form.trellis.gsim.name }} and 
		{{ form.trellis.imt.name }}
		can be input as space- or comma-separated lists of values. They can also be input with
		<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html" target="_blank">wildcards</a>:
		eGSIM will then select all matching items (wildcards are not implemented in the GUI).

The selection expression syntax has already been discussed in the

<h3 id="{{ test }}_response">Response</h3>

<p>
The reponse Object is of tyhis type is an Object with keys representing
the choosen measures of fit (MOF). Note that from a single MOF of the request
several values might be returned (e.g., choosing 'res' the MOFs in the response
are six: "Residuals Inter event Mean", "Residuals Inter event Std Dev",
"Residuals Intra event Mean", "Residuals Intra event Std Dev",
"Residuals Total Mean" and "Residuals Total Std Dev").
Each MOF is then mapped to an Object where each chosen IMT is in turn mapped 
to an Object of the choosen GMPEs, each mapped to the value of the GMPE
for the current MOF and IMT. Example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
	"Residuals Inter event Mean": {
		# Map each IMT to an Object of {GMPE: value}.
		# The same type of object is returned for all following MOF keys
		# and it will be indicated below with {...} 
		"PGA": {
			"BindiEtAl2011": 0.01,
			"CauzziEtAl2014": 0.02,
			# ...
			},
		... (iterate for all available IMTs)
	},
	"Residuals Inter event Std Dev": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Residuals Intra event Mean": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Residuals Intra event Std Dev": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Residuals Total Mean": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Residuals Total Std Dev": { ... same object as above ... },
	
	"Likelihood Inter event Median": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Likelihood Intra event Median": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Likelihood Total Median": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Likelihood Inter event IQR": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Likelihood Intra event IQR": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Likelihood Total IQR": { ... same object as above ... },

	"LLH": { ... same object as above ... },
	
	"MultivariateLLH": { ... same object as above ... },

	"Euclidean Distance-Based MDE Norm": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Euclidean Distance-Based sqrt Kappa": { ... same object as above ... },
	"Euclidean Distance-Based EDR": { ... same object as above ... }
	
}</code></pre>
<p class='footnote'>
LLH and MultivariateLLH include also the IMT "All". Euclidean Distance-Based
are not associated with any IMT, thus their values will be an Object
keyed by "" and associated to each {GMPE: value} pairs.
