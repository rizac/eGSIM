This simple service performs a GMPE selection based on several filtering parameter,
including matching tectonic regions defined in specified Area source (or Tectonic region) models.
</p>

<h3 id="{{ gsimsel }}_request">Request</h3>
<p>
A request to the GSIM selection service does not require any mandatory parameter: in case, all
OpenQuake's available GMPEs will be returned. This rather trivial search is usually refined
by specifying the desired GMPE names, IMTs or tectonic
region types (TRT): all parameter values (strings) may include specific wildcard characters 
with special meanings (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html" target='_blank'>here</a>
for details). In case of IMTs and TRTs, the GMPEs defined for any of the selected
intensity measure types and tectonic regions will be returned.
The search can be refined by specifying a tectonic region model (currently implemented
is only <a href="http://www.efehr.org/en/Documentation/specific-hazard-models/europe/seismogenic-sources/"
target='_blank'>SHARE</a>) and a location on earth (or a rectangular region): in this case,
the TRTs will be further filtered based on the model's tectonic regions including that point
(or intersecting the rectangle).
eGSIM currently does not exploit any model-defined mapping between TRTs and GMPEs, but simply
utilizes the tectonic regions defined on each GMPE in OpenQuake.

As discussed, parameters can be given in the endpoint URL (GET method) or as
separate text data in JSON or YAML format (POST method) and are:

<h3 id="{{ gsimsel }}_reqsponse">Response</h3>
<p>
The list of selected GMPEs will be returned as JSON-formatted array of strings or as CSV. In the
latter case, the user can choose the orientation (vertical vs. horizontal) for e.g.,
better visualization.
