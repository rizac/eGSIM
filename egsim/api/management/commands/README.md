## Introduction and basic usage

This directory contains the user-defined Django-admin
command `egsim_init`. 

Django will register an admin command for each Python 
module in this directory ("management/commands") whose 
name doesn't begin with an underscore (for details 
see the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/custom-management-commands/)).

`egsim_init` (re)populates the
database tables with all available GSIMs, IMTs
and Regionalizations, and creates all predefined Flatfiles 
in separate HDF files.

To execute the `egsim_init` command:
```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug"; python manage.py egsim_init
```
(type `--help` to list the command options, e.g. 
`--no-input` or `--dry-run`)

To list all commands:

```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug"; python manage.py --help
```

To test the commands:
```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug"; pytest tests/test_commands.py
```

(**NOTE**: `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` **value must be changed in production!**)


## Creating a new custom command

As you can see, in the "management/commands" directory most
Python modules start with an underscore.
These modules are hidden management commands called by `egsim_init` and
dealing with specific subtasks:

| Subcommand | Task |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| _egsim_oq | populates the db tables with OpenQuake data (GSIM, IMT) |
| _egsim_reg | populates the db tables with all Regionalizations (Geographic regions mapped to GSIMs) |
| _egsim_flatfiles | Parses predefined flatfiles in their original format and creates more efficient HDF files for usage within the API |

The convention is to prefix any command name with "egsim_" to avoid 
conflicts.

The commands are hidden for simplicity
because there is no need to call them separately: `egsim_init` 
takes only few seconds and can be run after any of those command
has been modified.

---

That said, in order to add a new command:

**[1]** Create a new Python module `<command_name>.py` 
   in this directory ("management/commands"). **HINT**: *copy and 
   rename an existing command module, it is usually easier than 
   starting from scratch*.
    
   The module must contain a subclass of `management.commands.EgsimBaseCommand`,
   and the command code must be implemented in its `handle` method. If the
   code needs to access external data, see next point.

   *Note: `EgsimBaseCommand` is simply a `django.core.management.base.BaseCommand`
   with shorthand utilities which you can inspect in `__init__.py`. For further
   details, see the [Django documentation](
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/custom-management-commands/)*

**[2]** (optional) If the command requires external data, put it in 
   the directory "management/commands/data/". E.g., if your data files are 
   inside "management/commands/data/abc", your code would read:
   ```python
    def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
        data_dir = self.data_path('abc')
   ```
   (see `EgsimBaseCommand.data_dir` for details). 
   
   *Note: Avoid committing large 
   data files. Think about providing URLs in case and document how to download 
   the data during installation*
   
**[3]** (optional, but very likely) If the command has to be added to the chain of
   subcommand issued by the main command `egsim_init`, add the module
   name in the `egsim_init.py` module (see the module implementation)
