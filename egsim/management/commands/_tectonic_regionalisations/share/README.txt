Note that from Subductionv6.1.zip we did include only "Inslab_SourceModel.shp"
and NOT the following (FIXME: should we?):

Interface_Polygon_SourceModel.shp: Polygon SHAPEfile used for interface seismicity 
Interface_TopTrace.shp: Top trace SHAPEfile for complex fault modeling of INTERFACE
Interface_BottomTrace.shp: Bottom trace SHAPEfile for complex fault modeling of INTERFACE
