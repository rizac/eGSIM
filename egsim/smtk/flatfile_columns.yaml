# Flatfile metadata registry. Syntax (in YAML format):
#
# <column_name>:
#   dtype:   The data type. Supported values are: null (the default when missing), int,
#            float, str, bool, datetime. Provide a list of values (all the same dtype)
#            for categorical data, i.e. when the column can only take on one of the
#            given values. If non-null, the data type will be used for data validation
#   default: The default value used to fill missing data, e.g. empty cell, null, NaN.
#            In Python (pandas), if the column dtype is int or bool, missing data will
#            not be valid unless you supply a default (e.g. 0 and False respwctively)
#   type:    The column type. Supported values are: rupture, site, distance, intensity
#            (rupture parameter, site parameter, distance measure, intensity measure).
#            Required only if the column denotes an OpenQuake parameter or measure
#   alias:   The column alias(es), as string or list of strings. If you want to rename
#            an OpenQuake parameter or distance, set the OpenQuake name as alias.
#            Note: intensity measure columns (e.g. PGA, SA, PGV) cannot have aliases
#   help:    The field help (optional), used for documentation
#   ">"      (with quotation marks because > and < are special characters in YAML)
#            The minimum value (endpoint excluded) of the column data. Currently not
#            used, included for potential future validation
#   ">="     The min. value (endpoint included) of the column data (see ">" for details)
#   "<"      The max. value (endpoint excluded) of the column data (see ">" for details)
#   "<="     The max. value (endpoint included) of the column data (see ">" for details)

# YAML notes:
# Unless required, strings (text sequences) don't need quotes (" or '). Date-times must be
# given as ISO-formatted strings (e.g.: 2006-01-01T12:31:21). YAML is a superset of JSON,
# so you can type sequences and mappings as JSON Arrays and Objects, respectively. If
# you want to type over multiple lines for readability, prefix the text with >-
# (see examples here below or at https://stackoverflow.com/a/3790497)
